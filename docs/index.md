### What is InterLang?

InterLang is a Service with an SDK for building Internationalized full-stack web applications. 
What do we mean by Internationalized? InterLang gives you as a developer the ability to build apps that users with different languages can use. Just by using the InterLang SDK, you can add the feature that would enable your users translate your website into the language suitable for them. This means you can build your website in english, french, afrikaans, and your viewer can decide to view your website in spanish, german, portuguese and many more. This makes your website very powerful, and user friendly. You use React, Vite, NextJS, and any other supported Javascript framework, or you can just use it in your basic browser javascript.

You can perform realtime translations, however this has a slower response time. For a faster response time, InterLang provides features that configures the languages needed for  faster translations, however, in your dashboard, you need to configure and pre-process the urls in your website. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration, and your users would be able to translate your application in seconds.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, InterLang can help you build interactive, dynamic, and International web applications.

### How to use the docs

On the left side of the screen, you'll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K).

To get started, checkout the Installation guide.

### Pre-Requisites

Although our docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, we need to establish a baseline so that the docs can stay focused on InterLang functionality. We'll make sure to provide links to relevant documentation whenever we introduce a new concept.

To get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. If you need to brush up on your Javascript skills, check out on some Javascript Foundations Courses, which will introduce you to the fundamentals. Then, learn more about Javascript by building simple applications.
